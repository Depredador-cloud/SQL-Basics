## SQLite

### What is SQLite?

SQLite is a lightweight, disk-based database that doesn't require a separate server process. It is self-contained, serverless, and zero-configuration, making it ideal for embedded database applications.

### Installation and Setup

1. **Download**: Obtain the SQLite binaries from [SQLite Download Page](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html).
2. **Setup**: Extract the binaries and place them in a directory accessible from your system's PATH.

### Basic Commands

- **Creating a Database**: `sqlite3 database_name.db`
- **Creating a Table**:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE table_name (
      column1 datatype,
      column2 datatype,
      column3 datatype
  );
  ```

---

## Basic SQL Commands

### SELECT Statement

The `SELECT` statement is used to query data from a database.

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
```

### WHERE Clause

The `WHERE` clause is used to filter records.

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

### INSERT Statement

The `INSERT` statement is used to add new rows to a table.

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, ...);
```

### UPDATE Statement

The `UPDATE` statement is used to modify existing records.

```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
```

### DELETE Statement

The `DELETE` statement is used to remove records.

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

---

## Advanced SQL Commands

### JOIN Operations

- **INNER JOIN**: Returns records that have matching values in both tables.
  ```sql
  SELECT columns
  FROM table1
  INNER JOIN table2
  ON table1.column = table2.column;
  ```

- **LEFT JOIN**: Returns all records from the left table and matched records from the right table.
  ```sql
  SELECT columns
  FROM table1
  LEFT JOIN table2
  ON table1.column = table2.column;
  ```

- **RIGHT JOIN**: Returns all records from the right table and matched records from the left table.
  ```sql
  SELECT columns
  FROM table1
  RIGHT JOIN table2
  ON table1.column = table2.column;
  ```

### GROUP BY and HAVING Clauses

- **GROUP BY**: Groups rows that have the same values into summary rows.
  ```sql
  SELECT column, COUNT(*)
  FROM table_name
  GROUP BY column;
  ```

- **HAVING**: Filters records that work on grouped records.
  ```sql
  SELECT column, COUNT(*)
  FROM table_name
  GROUP BY column
  HAVING condition;
  ```

### Subqueries

Subqueries are nested queries that provide data to the enclosing query.

```sql
SELECT column1
FROM table_name
WHERE column2 = (SELECT column FROM table WHERE condition);
```

---

## Database Design

### Normalization

Normalization is the process of organizing data to reduce redundancy.

- **First Normal Form (1NF)**: Eliminate duplicate columns and create separate tables for related data.
- **Second Normal Form (2NF)**: Remove subsets of data that apply to multiple rows.
- **Third Normal Form (3NF)**: Remove columns that are not dependent on the primary key.

### Indexing

Indexes improve the speed of data retrieval operations.

- **Creating an Index**:
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX index_name
  ON table_name (column1, column2, ...);
  ```

### Primary and Foreign Keys

- **Primary Key**: A unique identifier for a record.
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE table_name (
      id INT PRIMARY KEY,
      ...
  );
  ```

- **Foreign Key**: A field that uniquely identifies a row of another table.
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE table_name (
      id INT,
      foreign_id INT,
      FOREIGN KEY (foreign_id) REFERENCES other_table(id)
  );
  ```

---

## Performance Tuning

### Query Optimization

- **EXPLAIN Command**: Analyzes and displays the execution plan of a query.
  ```sql
  EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN
  SELECT * FROM table_name;
  ```

- **Indexing**: Proper use of indexes can significantly improve query performance.

### Best Practices

- **Avoid SELECT *:** Always specify the columns you need.
- **Use LIMIT:** To limit the number of rows returned by a query.
  ```sql
  SELECT column1, column2
  FROM table_name
  LIMIT number;
  ```

This guide provides an extensive overview of SQL, including basic and advanced topics. For in-depth learning and hands-on practice, refer to the additional resources and continue exploring real-world scenarios to master SQL.

## Best Practices

### Writing Efficient SQL Queries

1. **Avoid SELECT *:** Always specify the columns you need. This reduces the amount of data transferred and improves performance.
   ```sql
   SELECT column1, column2
   FROM table_name;
   ```

2. **Use Aliases:** Use table and column aliases to make your queries more readable.
   ```sql
   SELECT t.column1 AS alias1, t.column2 AS alias2
   FROM table_name AS t;
   ```

3. **Use Subqueries and CTEs:** Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and subqueries can simplify complex queries.
   ```sql
   WITH CTE AS (
       SELECT column1, column2
       FROM table_name
       WHERE condition
   )
   SELECT *
   FROM CTE;
   ```

4. **Index Appropriately:** Use indexes to speed up query performance but avoid over-indexing as it can slow down write operations.

5. **Optimize Joins:** Use the appropriate type of join (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT) and ensure that the join conditions are indexed.
   ```sql
   SELECT a.column1, b.column2
   FROM table1 AS a
   INNER JOIN table2 AS b ON a.id = b.id;
   ```

6. **Filter Early:** Apply WHERE clauses as early as possible to reduce the amount of data processed.
   ```sql
   SELECT column1, column2
   FROM table_name
   WHERE condition
   ORDER BY column1;
   ```

7. **Limit Result Sets:** Use the LIMIT clause to restrict the number of rows returned by a query.
   ```sql
   SELECT column1, column2
   FROM table_name
   WHERE condition
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

### Maintaining Data Integrity

1. **Use Constraints:** Enforce data integrity using PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, CHECK, and NOT NULL constraints.
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE table_name (
       id INT PRIMARY KEY,
       column1 VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
       column2 INT UNIQUE,
       column3 VARCHAR(255) CHECK (column3 IN ('value1', 'value2')),
       column4 INT,
       FOREIGN KEY (column4) REFERENCES other_table(id)
   );
   ```

2. **Normalize Your Data:** Apply normalization techniques to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.

3. **Handle NULLs Appropriately:** Be mindful of how NULL values are handled in your queries and logic.
   ```sql
   SELECT column1
   FROM table_name
   WHERE column2 IS NOT NULL;
   ```

4. **Use Transactions:** Group related SQL commands into transactions to ensure atomicity and consistency.
   ```sql
   BEGIN TRANSACTION;
   -- SQL statements
   COMMIT;
   ```

### Security Best Practices

1. **Use Strong Passwords:** Ensure that all database user accounts have strong, unique passwords.

2. **Limit Privileges:** Grant users the minimum privileges necessary to perform their tasks.
   ```sql
   GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON database_name.* TO 'username'@'host';
   ```

3. **Encrypt Sensitive Data:** Use encryption to protect sensitive data both at rest and in transit.

4. **Regular Backups:** Regularly back up your database and verify the backups for consistency and integrity.
   ```sh
   pg_dump database_name > backup_file.sql
   ```

5. **Monitor and Audit:** Regularly monitor and audit database activities to detect and respond to potential security threats.

### Database Maintenance

1. **Regular Maintenance Tasks:** Perform regular maintenance tasks such as vacuuming, analyzing, and rebuilding indexes.
   ```sql
   VACUUM;
   ANALYZE;
   ```

2. **Monitor Performance:** Use monitoring tools and techniques to keep an eye on database performance and identify bottlenecks.

3. **Update and Patch:** Keep your database software up-to-date with the latest patches and updates to ensure security and stability.

### Handling Large Data Sets

1. **Partitioning:** Use table partitioning to manage large data sets more efficiently.
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE partitioned_table (
       id INT,
       column1 VARCHAR(255),
       column2 DATE
   )
   PARTITION BY RANGE (column2);
   ```

2. **Batch Processing:** Process large data sets in batches to avoid long-running transactions and locks.
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2)
   SELECT column1, column2
   FROM other_table
   WHERE condition
   LIMIT 1000;
   ```

3. **Archiving:** Regularly archive old data to separate tables or databases to keep the primary database lean and efficient.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **Deadlocks:** Identify and resolve deadlocks by analyzing the locking behavior of your transactions.
2. **Slow Queries:** Use the EXPLAIN command to analyze and optimize slow-running queries.
3. **Data Corruption:** Regularly check for and repair data corruption using database-specific tools and commands.

### Documentation and Collaboration

1. **Document Your Schema:** Maintain up-to-date documentation of your database schema, including table structures, constraints, and relationships.
2. **Use Version Control:** Store SQL scripts and database schema changes in a version control system like Git.
3. **Collaborate Effectively:** Use collaboration tools and best practices to work effectively with other database developers and administrators.
